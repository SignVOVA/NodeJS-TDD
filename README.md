# NodeJS-TDD

Create scalable and rock-solid applications for desktop, web, and mobile devices using a test-driven development process and Node.js. In this short course Alex Zanfir shows how to plan and write tests with Node.js and useful Node.js-based frameworks such as Mocha and Should.js. He'll test both the data and web layers of an example API and show how design solutions can emerge from testing.
